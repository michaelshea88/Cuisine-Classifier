# Text Classification with Recipe Data
This is the Capstone Project I completed for General Assembly's [Data Science Immersive](https://generalassemb.ly/education/data-science-immersive). The goal was to use text data from recipes to predict a recipe's cuisine. 


Initially, my idea for the project was to develop an algorithm to predict a recipe's user rating based on it's ingredients, cooking time, difficulty, and instructions. The goal would be to figure out which factors influence a recipe's rating the most. Do short, easy recipes get the highest ratings? Do recipes that include beets get lower ratings than recipes without beets?  However, once I found a good data source I realized I wouldn't be able to predict ratings after all due to 

I used the [Yummly Recipe API](https://developer.yummly.com/) to collect over 25,000 recipes from [Yummly.com](http://www.yummly.com/).
